Lightweight Docker utility for curl, wget, ping, screen, psql, mysql, et al

Packed with a simple api server to keep it even if there are some scripts up and running in screen or bash

```
* screen
* curl
* mongodb-tools
* wget
* redis
* httpie
* iputils-ping
* jq
* flask
* nano
* vim
* postgresql-client
* bash
```

WIP - will keep including tools further needed for debugging Kubernetes / Docker based deployments
